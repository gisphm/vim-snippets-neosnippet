# Vim-Snippets

1. just a copy from [vim-snippets][1] repo

2. with script [update-snippets](update-snippets), snippets should be converted
    into neosnippet format.

3. with this repo, [neosnippet.vim][2] does not need to configure the compatibility.

## Further Info
Please read what [vim-snippets][1] describes.

## TODO
1. [update-snippets](update-snippets) still needs more modification.
    > for now, the `*.snip` in [neosnippets](neosnippets/) directory is just copied
    > and renamed from original one. There are more options in neosnippet format, such
    > as `abbr`, `alias`, `regexp`, `options`. The `abbr` and `alias` can be read
    > from snippets' contents and simply copied.

## License
Just as the original [vim-snippets][1] plugin, all the snippets are licensed
under the terms of the MIT license.
